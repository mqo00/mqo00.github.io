In my junior year fall *(2020)*, I took a graduate-level education class called *Educational Goals, Instruction, and Assessment* ([85-738 EGIA]), in which the individual term project is to develop a 10-hrs educational experience in either a real-world or imaginative context.

Because of my previous experiences with [CS Academy] and my role as the president of [Project Ignite], I immediately thought of a CS education after-school project for high school students, and in particular App Development because it’s a commonly proposed topic. 

Throughout the semester, I applied the big class themes of iterative backward design and alignment, and I spent 10+ hours per week on average. The final writeup, [App Development for High School Students][writeup], is a 52 pages document in which I 

1. specified the profile of students participating in Project Ignite, 
2. identified cognitive and metacognitive learning goals that align with state-level goals for CS education, 
3. developed the assessment and 
4. instructional methods aligned with goals, and 
5. designed evaluation research on the effectiveness of workshop exit surveys. 

Each section provides full justification of design drawing from the class reading materials, and is tailored for my particular context of a 10-week collaborative project with 4-6 high school students and 2+ CMU students as advisors in [Project Ignite][PI].
