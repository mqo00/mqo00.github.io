In my junior year fall *(2020)*, I took a graduate-level education class called *Educational Goals, Instruction, and Assessment* ([85-738 EGIA]), in which the individual term project is to develop a 10-hrs educational experience in either a real-world or imaginative context.

Because of my previous experiences with [CS Academy] and my role as the president of [Project Ignite], I immediately thought of a CS education after-school project for high school students, and in particular App Development because it’s a commonly proposed topic. 

Throughout the semester, I applied the big class themes of iterative backward design and alignment, and I spent 10+ hours per week on average. The final writeup, [App Development for High School Students][writeup], is a 52 pages document in which I 

1. specified the profile of students participating in Project Ignite, 
2. identified cognitive and metacognitive learning goals that align with state-level goals for CS education, 
3. developed the assessment and 
4. instructional methods aligned with goals, and 
5. designed a evaluation research on the effectiveness of workshop exit surveys.

| *I also increased the number of female applicant by 5%, and the number of racial minority applicants by 10% than last year (2018-2019 semester).* |

Each section provides full justification of design drawing from the class reading materials, and is tailored for my particular context of a 10-week collaborative project with 4-6 high school students and 2+ CMU students as advisors in [Project Ignite][PI].
