Besides the [individual project], there’s a group project of designing a Big Ideas Synthesis for EGIA. Our team, *The Igniters*, collaboratively developed a 63-pages Google Document to synthesize the theoretical-based educational practices dedicated to a specific audience — novice educators.

In terms of team collaboration, we held weekly meetings, rotated among the jobs of coordinator, note taker, and time keeper, updated the design journal regularly, and completed our self-assigned weekly tasks. 

For unique individual contributions, I’m the main organizer for the table of content and the template for organizing each sub-section, which is indeed a challenging task as the ideas were learned rather discretely and bottom-up, and there are various constraints and limitations for time and format. But it's one of my strengths to put concepts and topics into logically coherent categories and hierarchies and I managed to work it out.
