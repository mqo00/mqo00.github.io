      <p> Hi, I’m <b>Christina Ma</b>, a 2022er at Carnegie Mellon University, studying dual degrees of Cognitive Science and Computer Science and minor in Design for Learning. 
          I’m interested in the <i>application of learning science theories in education technologies, specifically in the context of informal CS education</i>, and I’m planning to pursue grad schools after graduation to do more research in this area.
