      <p markdown="1"> Hi, I’m <b>Christina Ma</b>, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University Human-Computer Interaction Institute, co-advised by Dr. [Ken Koedinger] & Dr. [Sherry (Tongshuang) Wu].
      </p>
      <p markdown="1"> My research interests are in the intersection of LLM and CS education. I design, build, and evaluate LLM‑based educational applications, such as a teachable agent for debugging in CS1 ([HypoCompass], AIED24 Best Paper), and an interactive tutor to train prompt programming for end-users ([ROPE], TOCHI 2025). My goal is to explore what the optimal human‑AI task delegation is for the future and how to evaluate and train people to work with AI, especially in a programming context.
      For details of my recent [research] projects, check out my [publications].
      Here's my <a href="/assets/Christina_Ma_CV.pdf">CV</a>.

  <!-- I have explored different ways of interaction to minimize risks and maximize the effectiveness of LLM, an in-house LLM TA assistant in answering student questions ([AI-TA]) -->

  I got my undergraduate dual degrees of Cognitive Science and Computer Science and a minor in Design for Learning at CMU in 2022. Feel free to learn more about my leadership and educational [activities][activity], various writing, technology, design & art [projects][portfolio] during undergrad, and some [fun facts][fun]!
