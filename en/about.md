      <p markdown="1"> Hi, I’m <b>Christina Ma</b>, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University Human-Computer Interaction Institute, co-advised by Dr. [Ken Koedinger] & Dr. [Sherry (Tongshuang) Wu].
      </p>
      <p markdown="1"> My research interests lay in the intersection of LLM and CS education. I have explored different ways of interaction to minimize risks and maximize the effectiveness of LLM in student-facing or instructor-facing applications, including a GPT-based teachable agent ([HypoCompass], AIED24 Best Paper) to help students learn debugging and an in-house LLM TA assistant ([AI-TA]) in answering student questions. For details of my recent research projects, check out my [publications].
