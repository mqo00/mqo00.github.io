      <p> Hi, I’m <b>Christina Ma</b>, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University Human-Computer Interaction Institute, co-advised by Dr. [Ken Koedinger] & Dr. [Sherry (Tongshuang) Wu]. I got my undergraduate dual degrees of Cognitive Science and Computer Science and a minor in Design for Learning at CMU in 2022. 
          I’m interested in the <i>application of learning science theories in education technologies, specifically in the context of CS education</i>. Currently I’m interested in how to use large language model-based AI code-generation tools to assist CS education.
