Here are some fun facts about me!

## Tai Chi Sword

I’m Chinese, so as you may expect, I do martial art (haha it is such an old stereotypical joke). But anyway I did learn some Tai Chi, and in particular **Tai Chi Sword**.

## Cooking

I love, love cooking. I’m not bragging, but I’m such a foodie and good amateur cook (especially traditional Chinese cuisine, partly because as students who study abroad we have to cook ourselves if we want some legit Chinese food lol). Just to show you some good photos.

## Outdoors
I love outdoors and all sorts of sporty activities! Besides the martial art above, I've done Spartan, white water rafting, kayaking, biking, zipline, hiking, archery, climbing, skiing, snowboarding, figure skating, horse riding, camping, paintball, trampoline, axe throwing ... just to name a few! My skills may not be too impressive, but I did take some good photos :joy:

[^1]: if you don’t know yet, my Chinese name basically means a thousand seagulls because I was born in 2000 in Xiamen, a seaside city full of seagulls!
