During my freshman year, Iâ€™ve been involved with developing exercise content for [CMU CS Academy], an online, graphics-based CS intro curriculum in Python offered by CMU. I really learned a ton in this year of experience with CS Academy (and the two instructors of 15-110, Dr. David Kosbie & Dr. Mark Stehlik who opened this door for me), both on how programming can be so fun and useful in real life, and on how technology-based platforms can spread high-quality educational resources to such a large audience. As someone who have never learned any programming before college, this first acquaintance was so fun and rewarding that it sow a strong interest of both education and CS in me.
