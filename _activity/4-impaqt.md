I’m selected as a member of the [IMPAQT] team of CMU in 2019, which is a cultural communication program between the Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses of CMU ([CMUQ]).

Unfortunately, our tour to Qatar has been canceled for two spring semesters *(2020 & 2021)* because of the pandemic and I will already be graduated before the IMPAQT program relaunch. However, that week when we host our friends from CMUQ is still an unforgettable experience: we’ve had a lot of in-depth conversations and bond-building activities (and I of course led them to visit [CMOA]). I missed my folks a lot :sob:
