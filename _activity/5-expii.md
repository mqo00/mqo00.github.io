During my freshman summer (2018), I was a part-time product design intern at [Expii, Inc.][expii], where I assisted user experience research for their new online math curriculum “[Daily Challenge with Po-Shen Loh][DC]” via remote communications with parents. I helped with the content develop and the marketing team, writing articles about mathematic competitions (received average view of 1,000+), proposing marketing plans, designing promotional materials (poster, slides, animated instructions, and etc.), and helping organize online talks (received 500+ audience).

During the winter (2019), I arranged the visit to rural schools at Ruijin (which are the connections I built while I operated the book donation organization called book-way), where Dr. Po-Shen Loh led two engaging math lectures. We also sat in an example math lesson and met with the instructors in a discussion-based seminar afterwards.
