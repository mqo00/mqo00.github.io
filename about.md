    Hi, I’m <b>Christina Ma</b>, a 2022er at Carnegie Mellon University, studying dual degrees of Cognitive Science and Computer Science and minor in Design for Learning. I’m interested in the application of  learning science theories in education technologies, and I’m planning to pursue grad schools after graduation to do more research in this area.
