This website itself is my attempt to practice the skills and learn some new tools for web design.

Originally I used javaScript / HTML / CSS and node.js to develop a static website, but then I figured there’s a more elegant solution using [Jekyll], so I found a [template] and use my [GitHub] page to host this website. I also host it using my Andrew ID domain that CMU provides, as my parents said somehow they couldn’t access the mqo00.github.io page.
