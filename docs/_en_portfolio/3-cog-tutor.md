In my sophomore spring *(2020)*, I took the class *Applications in Cognitive Science* ([85-395/795][85395]) with Dr. Roberta Klatzky, and in the term paper, we were asked to write about a cognitive science’s application in real life, summarize its theoretical foundations and evaluate the product.

Inspired by another graduate-level seminar course that I was taking that semester with Dr. Kenneth Koedinger, *Human Learning and How to Optimize It* ([05-899]), I wrote about Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), and in particular its feedback functionality with regard to students’ behaviors. 

In the final paper, *Performance or Learning[^1]? Feedback provided by cognitive tutors may change the outcome*, my main idea is that 
1. **immediate** and **corrective** feedback work better for short retention interval, improves the speed of learning, and thus result in better **performance**, but it fails to support transfer learning;
2. in contrast, **delayed** and **elaborative** feedback better support transfer and long-term retention, which describe greater **learning** versus performance gain.
