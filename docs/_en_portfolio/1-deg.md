In my junior year spring *(2021)*, I took *Design Educational Games* ([05-418/818 DEG][05418]) with Dr. [Erik Harpstead].

In DEG, we individually write [critique blogs] of educational games using the [EDGE framework], conduct Cognitive Task Analysis ([CTA]) on geometry problems, and brainstorm, prototype, and playtest on [board games] that target at teaching historical thinking skills. You can find detailed information about these individual assignments in my [medium] posts. 

DEG is a very fun and rewarding experience, I learned many game design & research methods and developed an interest in game as the educational technology that has the potential of incorporating learning science principles, which eventually led to my [honor thesis]. Additionally, I’ve got to apply the methods and models we’ve learned in class in a game design project.

The final project of DEG is to design an educational game in a team; after brainstorming, our team decided to adopt my idea and design a parent education game. After discussing the 3 game ideas that my teammate [Tony Tao] offered, we decided to implement a chat game on Unity to **teach Chinese parents *How to Become a Better Parent*** (if you use a 64-bit Windows system, you can download our game [here][game], or visit us on our booth at DEG's gather.town [showcase]).

In this project, I researched & set the **learning objectives** (here’s a list of [parenting dos and don’ts][parent guide] that we incorporated into the game), wrote the **interactive narrative** for the chat game, conducted **playtesting** sessions, and designed the **evaluation protocol** for this game’s educational value on our target audience. My amazing teammate Tony created all the beautiful UI & game system, and he also implemented the whole game in Unity, which is an insane amount of work. For more information on game implementation, please refer to [Tony’s website][Tony Tao].

Within 6 weeks, we started from scratch and ended up with an educational game in 2 languages with 3 different endings and a total of 32 possibilities converged into mainly 4 storylines. Our professor said, ***“it’s probably the most impressive digital game that’s ever been made for this class.”***

If you’re interested in learning more about the game design process, here’s our 30 pages [final writeup] that delineated our learning goals, experience goals, ideation & prototyping, and playtesting & evaluation process.
