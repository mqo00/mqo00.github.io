In my junior year spring *(2021)*, I took *Design Educational Games* ([05-418/818 DEG][05418]) with Dr. [Erik Harpstead].

In this course, we individually write [critique blogs] of educational games using the [EGDE framework], conduct Cognitive Task Analysis ([CTA]) and [playtesting] on geometry or history game, and you can find detailed information about these individual assignments in my [medium] posts. 

This class is a very fun and rewarding experience, I learned many game design & research methods and developed an interest in game as the educational technology that has the potential of incorporating learning science principles, which eventually led to my [honor thesis]. Additionally, I’ve got to apply the methods and models we’ve learned in class in a game design project.

The final project of DEG is to design an educational game in a team; after brainstorming, our team decided to adopt my idea and design a parent education game. After discussing the 3 game ideas that my teammate [Tony Tao] offered, we decided to implement a chat game on Unity to **teach Chinese parents *How to Become a Better Parent*** (download our game [here][game], or visit us on our gather.town [showcase]).

In this project, I researched & set the learning objectives, wrote the interactive narrative for the chat game, conducted playtesting sessions, and designed the evaluation protocol for this game’s educational value on our target audience. My amazing teammate Tony created all the beautiful UI & game system, and he also implemented the whole game in Unity, which is an insane amount of work. For more information on game implementation, please refer to [Tony’s website][Tony Tao].

Within 6 weeks, we started from scratch and ended up with an educational game in two languages with 3 different endings and a total of 32 possibilities converged into mainly 4 storylines. If you’re interested in learning more about the game design process, here’s our 30 pages [final writeup] that delineated our learning goals, experience goals, ideation & prototyping, and playtesting & evaluation process, and here’s a list of [parenting dos and don’ts][parent guide] that we’ve incorporated into the game.
