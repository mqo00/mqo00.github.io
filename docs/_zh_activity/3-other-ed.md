自高中毕业以来，我便在不同的组织与不同年龄段的学生中积累了丰富的家教、助教经验。在担任大学计算机入门课助教与社团的项目导师之外，我曾在上海三立当了两个托福高级班的20名学生两个月的助教，为学生们设计了个性化的学习策略，并与家长们保持沟通。我也曾在PeerInsight担任过SAT导师，带了25个学生，有考试的学生们平均提高了30分。大一时，我通过学校的LGC，在匹兹堡本地的Allderdice高中写作中心、Assemble的课外创客项目、以及Gelfand Outreac的周末儿童创意课堂里担任了导师或助教。
Besides being a [TA] in college-level classes and a [project advisor][PI] in Project Ignite, I’ve accumulated a lot of tutoring, mentoring, and teaching assistant experiences with different age groups of students through various organizations since I graduated from high school.

For example, I had assisted teaching of English TOEFL classes of 20 students in Sanli for two months, during which I designed personalized study strategies for students and communicated with parents; I had tutored SAT for over 25 students in PeerInsight and helped improve their SAT scores for 30 points on average. 

During my freshman year, I’ve also worked at CMU’s Leonard Gelfand Center ([LGC]) as a tutor at the [Writing Center of Allderdice High School][allderdice], a mentor in [Assemble’s Girls' Maker Night program][assemble], and/or a teaching assistant in the [Gelfand Outreach] program for kindergarten and grade 1-2 children for about 2.5 hrs/week.
