I really learned a ton in this year of experience with CS Academy (and the two instructors of [15-110][110], Dr. David Kosbie & Dr. Mark Stehlik who opened this door for me), both on how programming can be so fun and useful in real life, and on how technology-based platforms can spread high-quality educational resources to such a large audience. As someone who have never learned any programming before college, this first acquaintance was so fun and rewarding that it sow a strong interest of both **education** and **CS** in me.
