In my sophomore fall *(2019)*, I took the 3-unit mini-class [24-104 *Maker Series: Intro to Modern Making*][24104], in which we learned some introductory techniques for 3D printing, laser cutting/engraving, technical drawing & part modeling using SolidWorks and CAD, and Arduino electronics.

For the final project, our group applied all skills learned in class and made a flowerpot with a soil sensor to detect if the plant need water. I 3D-printed some of the acrylic flowerpots and made the main design for the wood box which store the Arduino, and I also helped with assembling the LEDs and sensor and testing the Arduino code.
