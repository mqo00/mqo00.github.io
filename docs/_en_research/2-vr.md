In *Spring 2021*, I registered an Independent Study with Dr. [Lauren Herckis] to do some research on the new Grand Challenge course, Unreality: Immersive and Spatial Media, which aims to introduce students to immersive and spatial media; contextualize these media historically, culturally, and technologically; and problematize design and development efforts.

In the next semester *(2021 Spring)*, I will be doing independent research on the Grand Challenge First-Year Seminar course [66-129 Unreality: Immersive and Spatial Media][unreality] with the instructors Dr. Lauren Herckis and Tom Corbett.
